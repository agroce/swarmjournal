%
Swarm testing is a novel and inexpensive way to improve the diversity
of test cases generated during random testing.
%
Increased diversity leads to improved coverage and fault detection.
% 
In swarm testing, the usual practice of potentially including all
features in every test case is abandoned. 
%
Rather, a large ``swarm'' of randomly generated configurations, each
of which omits some features, is used, with configurations
receiving equal resources.
%
We have identified two mechanisms by which feature omission leads to
better exploration of a system's state space.
%
First, some features actively prevent the system from executing
interesting behaviors; e.g., ``pop'' calls may prevent a stack data
structure from executing a bug in its overflow detection logic.
%
Second, even when there is no active suppression of behaviors, test
features compete for space in each test, limiting the depth to which
logic driven by features can
be explored.  
%
Experimental results show that swarm testing increases coverage and
can improve fault detection dramatically; for example, in a week of
testing it found 42\% more distinct ways to crash a collection of C
compilers than did the heavily hand-tuned default configuration of a
random tester.
